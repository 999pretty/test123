                    Hello React friends! I want to share my excitement on something amazing: React Hooks. React team in October last year and now they are becoming very popular quickly. I think Hooks will be next big thing in React and in this article, I will explain reasons.

First, let's remember what is React for people who not know. React is famous JavaScript library for making user interfaces and Facebook is maintaining it. React is good because it uses components, making it easy to create modular and reusable UI elements.

Now, we talk about Hooks!

Problem with Class Components
Before Hooks, React developers had two choices for making components: functional components and class components. Functional components were light and simple, but cannot manage state or use lifecycle methods. Class components had state management and lifecycle methods, but heavier syntax and some problems like writing extra code for constructors, bindings, and so on.

React Hooks Are Solution
React Hooks try to solve this problem by giving state and lifecycle features to functional components. Hooks are like functions that "hook" into React's state and lifecycle features. Now developers can create fully-featured components using simple, functional syntax without needing class components and their problems.

Why React Hooks Are Good
So, why Hooks will be next big thing in React? Here are some reasons:

Code more simple and clean: With Hooks, developers can write cleaner and easy-to-read code. Functional components with Hooks are more understandable and easy to maintain than class components, which need developers to deal with difficult inheritance, constructors, and binding.

Managing state is easier: Hooks give simple way to manage component state without needing other libraries or difficult solutions. The useState and useReducer hooks make state management very easy.

Custom Hooks for better code reuse: Custom Hooks let developers create reusable logic that can be shared between components. This makes code organization better and easier to maintain and update in a project.

Better lifecycle management: Hooks like useEffect make it easier for developers to work with component lifecycles. They give more intuitive way to handle side effects and remove need for many lifecycle methods like componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate, and componentWillUnmount.

Easy to use with existing code: Hooks can be used when you want, meaning developers can use them slowly in their projects without rewriting whole applications. This makes it easy to add Hooks into existing code.

Conclusion
React Hooks change how React developers work. They make it possible to write clean, maintainable code, make code reuse better, and simplify state and lifecycle management. As React community use Hooks more and find their potential, it is clear that Hooks will be next big thing in React development world.

If you have not tried yet, I suggest you try React Hooks. I am sure you will find them very useful addition to your React tools. Happy coding!
